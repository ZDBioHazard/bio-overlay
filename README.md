Bio's Portage Overlay
=====================

I enjoy hacking up my system, so I write ebuilds to expedite fixes or just mess
with stuff.

I figured that the world might want a enjoy a few of my ebuilds.

These are usually new packages or fixes I find on the
[Gentoo Bugzilla](http://bugs.gentoo.org/) and adapt for my use, but sometimes
I write my own from scratch too. I'll try to credit when I remember. :)

Notice about ebuilds
====================

Please note that I'm still pretty new at writing ebuilds, so the dependencies
or use flags may not always be entirely correct. I try.
